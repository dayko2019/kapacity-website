## 2023

- Support machine learning-based intelligent copy number prediction algorithm, and the tool provides the ability to
  predict expansion in advance.
- Support traffic surge identification algorithm, support the identification and emergency response capabilities of
  traffic surge scenarios, and can replace traditional responsive algorithms as application capacity protection.
- Supports custom copy portrait access verification, further controls the application rules of the algorithm output
  portrait, and reduces unexpected risks.
- Supports stability check and change fuse capabilities, supports custom index anomaly detection, and automatic pause
  and rollback capabilities after detecting anomalies.

## Future

- It fully supports the IHPA extension framework, and users can independently expand the behaviors and functions of IHPA
  without intrusion.
- Launch Kapacity Agent, which supports Pod Standby state switching, Pod health scoring, etc., further enhances the
  multi-level elasticity capability, and serves as the basic capability of the mixed department.
- Launched Kapacity Scheduler, which supports dynamic scheduling based on Pod resource usage and node resource remaining
  to reduce resource fragmentation problems, and supports more advanced scheduling strategies.
- Supports on-demand batch switching of Pod Online and Standby states to support time-sharing scheduling.
- It supports the recommendation of Pod resource specifications (CPU, memory, etc.) through intelligent algorithms, and
  supports the dynamic adjustment of Pod resource specifications through VPA.
- Support visual console, and support multi-dimensional cost and carbon emission calculation.
